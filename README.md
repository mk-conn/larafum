# Nextfeed 2

Nextfeed is a rss feed agreggator. Initially it was just an EmberJS frontend which consumed feeds from a Nextcloud Newsfeed installation. Unfortunately,
the API was not really handy in terms of consuming and dealing with feeds and articles so Nextfeed 2 is now based on Laravel (via json-api), 
picoFeed (which Nextcloud Newsfeed is also based on) and still an EmberJS frontend.
